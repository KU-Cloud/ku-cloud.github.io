abstract="This paper proposes fault tolerance service to satisfy QoS requirement in grid computing. The probability of failure in the grid computing is higher than in a tradition parallel computing. Since the failure of resources affects job execution fatally, fault tolerance service is essential in grid computing. And grid services are often expected to meet some minimum levels of quality of service (QoS) for desirable operation. However Globus toolkit does not provide fault tolerance service that supports fault detection service and management service and satisfies QoS requirement. In order to provide fault tolerance service and satisfy QoS requirements, we expand the definition of failure, such as process failure, processor failure, and network failure. And we propose fault detection service and fault management service and show simulation results.",
