abstract="In this paper, we propose a new mobile host protocol that is optimized to provide access to a Mobile IP enabled internet in support of fast moving wireless hosts. Actually, for fast moving wireless hosts, we need certain environment for seamless mobile computing that internet mobile users have to sit down or put laptop computer on some place, and so on. It could be using vehicles: automobile, train, subway, train express (TGV), etc. To address this, we define high speed movement environment. Then, we make up high speed movement environment to virtual organization (VO). Finally, we propose optimized hierarchical protocol in high speed movement environment that classifies global mobility into VO mobility (within a VO) and global mobility management. Handoffs in VO are locally managed and transparent to corresponding host (CH) while global mobility is managed with Mobile IPv6. Our proposed protocol improves handoff performance and significantly reduces signaling overhead for fast moving wireless hosts.",
