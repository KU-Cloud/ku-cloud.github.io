abstract="This paper proposes a new approach to rollback-recovery, using multi-agent in distributed computing system. Previous rollback-recovery protocols were dependent on inherent communication and operating system, which cause a decline of computing performance in distributed computing system. By using multi-agent, we propose rollback-recovery protocol which works independently on operating system. We define three kinds of agent. One is a recovery agent that performs rollback-recovery protocol after a failure. Other is an information agent that constructs domain knowledge as a rule of fault tolerance and information during failure-free operation. The other is the facilitator agent that controls the efficient communication between agents. Also we propose rollback-recovery protocol using multi-agent and simulate the proposed roll-back-recovery protocol using JAVA and agent communication language in CORBA environment.",
