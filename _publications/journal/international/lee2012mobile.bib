abstract="The mobile grid is a kind of grid computing that incorporates mobile devices into the infrastructure. Although mobile devices are typically more resource-constrained than static devices, it has potential to be used as grid resources because of its unique functionality such as location-awareness. In this paper, we propose a group-based fault tolerance scheduling algorithm that aims to improve utilization of resources and reliability of task execution in mobile grid through scheduling groups and fault tolerance algorithm. The experimental results showed that the group-based scheduling algorithm with replication is superior to the group-based scheduling algorithm without fault tolerance and the group-based scheduling algorithm with checkpointing.",
