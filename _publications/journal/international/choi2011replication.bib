abstract="Mobile grid computing is a computing environment that incorporates mobile devices to an existing grid environment and supports users' mobility. But this environment is not stable, so methodologies to cope with the reliability issue are needed. Fault tolerance approaches for task execution in grid computing can be categorized into replication and checkpoint. We apply these techniques to a SimGrid simulator to provide a fault tolerance for a mobile environment and show the results in this paper. The results demonstrate that the best solution for fault tolerance in mobile grid computing depends on the situations of the network. The contribution of this paper is the use of real-life trace data to simulate fault tolerance in a mobile grid computing.",
