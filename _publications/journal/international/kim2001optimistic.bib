title = "Optimistic scheduling algorithm for mobile transactions based on reordering",
abstract = "In this paper, we propose transaction processing algorithms in the broadcast environment. We take an optimistic approach for mobile transactions because (a) it needs a small number of messages for maintaining transactional consistency, and (b) it can make good use of broadcasting facilities from the servers. The more data conflicts occur, however, the more mobile transactions may be aborted. Thus, we accept reordering technique to reduce the number of aborted transactions; that is, whenever any kind of conflict is found from broadcast information, the system determine the operation orders without violating transactional consistency, not just aborting the mobile transactions unconditionally. The proposed algorithms - O-Post algorithm for update transaction and O-Pre algorithm for read-only transaction - do not need much information from the server while resulting in serializable executions. Finally, we also evaluate the performance behavior through simulation study.",
