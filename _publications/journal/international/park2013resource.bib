abstract = "Recently, research on utilizing mobile devices as resources in mobile cloud environments has been gaining attention because of the enhanced computing power of mobile devices, with the advent of quad-core chips. Such research is also motivated by the advance of communication networks as well as the growing population of users of smart phones, tablet PCs, and other mobile devices. However, the mobility of a mobile device causes system faults to occur more frequently, and system faults prevent applications running on mobile devices from being processed reliably. In this paper, we analyze and predict mobility by using the history and current information of location information of mobile devices. In addition, we define mobility groups for mobile devices by measuring the behavior of mobile devices and calculating the entropy, and we propose a resource provision technique.",
