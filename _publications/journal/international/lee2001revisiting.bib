abstract = "A lot of research efforts have focused on global serializability, global atomicity, and global deadlocks in multidatabase systems. Surprisingly, however, very few transaction processing model exists that ensures global serializability, global atomicity, and freedom from global deadlocks in a uniform manner. In this paper, we examine previous transaction processing models and propose a new transaction processing model that generates globally serializable and deadlock-free schedules in failure-prone multidatabase systems. A new transaction processing model adopts rigid conflict serializability as a correctness criterion on global serializability, and follows an emulated 2PC, criteria for global commitment, and an abort-based multidatabase recovery scheme for global seriazability in failure-prone multidatabase systems. In addition, a deadlock-free policy is suggested where rigid conflict serializability is enforced when each subtransaction, including redo transactions, begins its execution. To practically support a new transaction processing model, Rigid Ticket Ordering (RTO) methods are designed. The proposed transaction processing model has the following improvements: (a) it resolves abnormal direct conflicts identified in this paper, (b) it imposes no restrictions on the execution of local transactions, and (c) it relaxes the restrictions on the execution of global transactions.",
