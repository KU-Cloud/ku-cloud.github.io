abstract="The cloud computing is a computing paradigm that users can rent computing resources from service providers as much as they require. A spot instance in cloud computing helps a user to utilize resources with less expensive cost, even if it is unreliable. When a user performs tasks with unreliable spot instances, failures inevitably lead to the delay of task completion time and cause a seriously deterioration in the QoS of users. Therefore, we propose a price history based checkpointing scheme to avoid the delay of task completion time. The proposed checkpointing scheme reduces the number of checkpoint trials and improves the performance of task execution. The simulation results show that our scheme outperforms the existing checkpointing schemes in terms of the reduction of both the number of checkpoint trials and total costs per spot instance for user's bid.",
