abstract="Information and communication technologies enable people to access to various documentations and information. Huge documents and information in the Internet or storage disks have made search time more important. Especially as the volume size and the number of documents on the Internet increase, string search times and costs increase have become big burden to search service. But, most of string searching algorithms have not consider lexical structures nor vowels' occurrence frequency. Formal documents (articles, news, novels, etc.) have important characteristic that is `well-formed written' English. And words of formal documents have `limit number of words and alphabets' that are listed in a dictionary. The `limit number of words and alphabets' has predictable occurrence probability in real world's documentations.",
