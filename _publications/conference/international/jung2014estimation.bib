title = "An estimation-based task load balancing scheduling in spot clouds",
abstract = "Cloud computing is a computing paradigm in which users can rent computing resources from service providers according to their requirements. Cloud computing based on the spot market helps a user to obtain resources at a lower cost. However, these resources may be unreliable. In this paper, we propose an estimation-based distributed task workflow scheduling scheme that reduces the estimated generation compared to Genetic Algorithm (GA). Moreover, our scheme executes a user's job within selected instances and stretches the user's cost. The simulation results, based on a before-and-after estimation comparison, reveal that the task size is determined based on the performance of each instance and the task is distributed among the different instances. Therefore, our proposed estimation-based task load balancing scheduling technique achieves the task load balancing according to the performance of instances.",
