title = "Supporting transactional cache consistency in mobile database systems",
abstract = "In a mobile computing environment, caching of frequently accessed data has been shown to be a useful technique for reducing contention on the narrow bandwidth of the wireless channels. However, the traditional client/server strategies for supporting transactional cache consistency that require extensive communications between a client and a server are not appropriate in a mobile computing environment. In this paper, we propose a new protocol, called OCC-UTS (Optimisitic Concurrency Control with Update TimeStamp), to support transactional cache consistency in a wireless mobile computing environment by utilizing the broadcast-based solutions for the problem of invalidating caches. The consistency check on accessed data and the commitment protocol are implemented in a truly distributed fashion as an integral part of cache invalidation process, with most burden of consistency check being downloaded to mobile clients. Also, our esperiments based on an analytical model substantiate the basic idea and study the performance characteristics. Experimental results show that OCC-UTS protocol without local cache outperforms other competitor protocol, and the more frequent a mobile client accesses data items the more efficient OCC-UTS protocol with local cache is. With respect to disconnection, a mobile client aborts its transaction if it disconnects more than the invalidation broadcast window size. Thus, the tolerance to disconnection is improved if the invalidation broadcast window size is extended.",
