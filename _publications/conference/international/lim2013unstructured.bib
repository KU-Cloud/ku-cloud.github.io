abstract="Determining termination in dynamic environments is hard due to node joining and leaving. In previous studies on termination detection, some structures, such as spanning tree or computational tree, are used. In this work, we present an unstructured termination detection algorithm, which uses a gossip based scheme to cope with scalability and fault-tolerance issues. This approach allows the algorithm not to maintain specific structures even when nodes join and leave during runtime. These dynamic behaviors are prevalent in cloud computing environments and little attention has been paid by existing approaches. To measure the complexity of our proposed algorithm, a new metric, self-centered message complexity is used. Our evaluation over scalable settings shows that an unstructured approach has a significant merit to solve scalability and fault-tolerance problems with lower message complexity over existing algorithms.",
