abstract = "As information technology service matures to an even higher level and as sensor technology becomes embedded on person’s life, the needs to support and satisfy instant personal learning activity on own life without the limitation of time, space, and additional complement have become a vital point to everyday lives. Especially smartphone users are increased in a short-term lesson and exercise, and instant and short learning contents on mobile learning model. And programing subjects for distance learning are limitedly supported, since virtual practice environment is not appropriate for tutoring service. Programming practices lesson has frequent program errors and needs error correction by oneself or by a tutor. But on distance learning, it is almost impossible for a learner to be guided or correct lesson from a tutor. In this paper, well-formed programming practice scenarios, by that a learner could follow and learn program practice lesson, are supported and delivered by small-bite size learning contents. For well-formed programming practice scenarios, small bite learning contents are 10–15 min length and consists of lecture video, synchronized lecture slides video with lecture video, digital textbook, sample program execution drills, and modifiable program execution drills. Programming Exercise, a mobile learning app, provides learners with interactions between the learners and the contents by program practice.",
