    "abstract": "Recently, grid computing environment has being changed to the service-oriented grid integrated with Web Services for supporting more open, scalable and flexible grid architecture. In this architecture, a grid application is the service-oriented grid application in which Grid Services are executed according to the workflow of the grid application. This implies that the grid scheduling method needs to consider grid service characteristics. Although many grid scheduling methods have been developed, we need new grid scheduling method to reflect the service-oriented grid concept and to ensure performance of the grid application. Therefore, we propose the grid service performance model based on factors such as service availability, accessibility, reliability, throughput, and slowdown, and develop grid scheduling method to increase performance of the service-oriented grid application.",

    "abstract": "In recent years, cloud computing has become a significant technology trend because of various advantages including cost savings, flexibility, high availability, and scalability using virtualization technology. However, one of the concerns for using cloud computing is security. In fact, there are multiple attack surfaces in virtualized environments. In this paper, we build a fault tolerant cloud architecture using nested virtualization. With our constructed cloud architecture, we argue that a malicious virtual machine cannot subvert the whole virtual machines on the physical host machine. To support this, we compare the performance of two types of virtual machines (i.e., nested virtual machines and regular virtual machines). Results provide encouraging support for the validity of our cloud architecture with negligible performance degradation while having fault tolerance.",

But, most of string searching algorithms have not consider lexical structures nor vowels' occurrence frequency. Formal documents (articles, news, novels, etc.) have important characteristic that is `well-formed written' English.

    "abstract": "As information technology service matures to an even higher level and as sensor technology becomes embedded on person’s life, the needs to support and satisfy instant personal learning activity on own life without the limitation of time, space, and additional complement have become a vital point to everyday lives. Especially smartphone users are increased in a short-term lesson and exercise, and instant and short learning contents on mobile learning model. And programing subjects for distance learning are limitedly supported, since virtual practice environment is not appropriate for tutoring service. Programming practices lesson has frequent program errors and needs error correction by oneself or by a tutor. But on distance learning, it is almost impossible for a learner to be guided or correct lesson from a tutor. In this paper, well-formed programming practice scenarios, by that a learner could follow and learn program practice lesson, are supported and delivered by small-bite size learning contents. For well-formed programming practice scenarios, small bite learning contents are 10–15 min length and consists of lecture video, synchronized lecture slides video with lecture video, digital textbook, sample program execution drills, and modifiable program execution drills. Programming Exercise, a mobile learning app, provides learners with interactions between the learners and the contents by program practice.",

A spot instance in cloud computing helps a user to utilize resources with less expensive cost, even if it is unreliable. When a user performs tasks with unreliable spot instances, failures inevitably lead to the delay of task completion time and cause a seriously deterioration in the QoS of users. To solve the problem, we propose the VM migration scheme to reduce the job waiting time. And in this scheme we use our previously proposed checkpointing method. When a running instance occurs the out-of-bid situation (failure), the VM on the failed instance is to a new instance. Our proposed VM migration scheme reduces the rollback time and the task waiting time when an instance occur the out-of-bid situation. The simulation results show that our scheme achieves performance improvements in the task execution time of 68.94%, 68.61%, and 46.35% compared with the hour-boundary checkpointing scheme, the rising edge-driven checkpointing scheme, and our previously proposed checkpointing scheme., respectively Further, our scheme outperforms the existing schemes in terms of the reduction the total costs per spot instances for a user's bid.",

Cloud computing based on the spot market helps a user to obtain resources at a lower cost. However, these resources may be unreliable. In this paper, we propose an estimation-based distributed task workflow scheduling scheme that reduces the estimated generation compared to Genetic Algorithm (GA). Moreover, our scheme executes a user's job within selected instances and stretches the user's cost. The simulation results, based on a before-and-after estimation comparison, reveal that the task size is determined based on the performance of each instance and the task is distributed among the different instances. Therefore, our proposed estimation-based task load balancing scheduling technique achieves the task load balancing according to the performance of instances.",

    "abstract": "In a mobile computing environment, caching of frequently accessed data has been shown to be a useful technique for reducing contention on the narrow bandwidth of the wireless channels. However, the traditional client/server strategies for supporting transactional cache consistency that require extensive communications between a client and a server are not appropriate in a mobile computing environment. In this paper, we propose a new protocol, called OCC-UTS (Optimisitic Concurrency Control with Update TimeStamp), to support transactional cache consistency in a wireless mobile computing environment by utilizing the broadcast-based solutions for the problem of invalidating caches. The consistency check on accessed data and the commitment protocol are implemented in a truly distributed fashion as an integral part of cache invalidation process, with most burden of consistency check being downloaded to mobile clients. Also, our esperiments based on an analytical model substantiate the basic idea and study the performance characteristics. Experimental results show that OCC-UTS protocol without local cache outperforms other competitor protocol, and the more frequent a mobile client accesses data items the more efficient OCC-UTS protocol with local cache is. With respect to disconnection, a mobile client aborts its transaction if it disconnects more than the invalidation broadcast window size. Thus, the tolerance to disconnection is improved if the invalidation broadcast window size is extended.",

    "abstract": "Determining termination in dynamic environments is hard due to node joining and leaving. In previous studies on termination detection, some structures, such as spanning tree or computational tree, are used. In this work, we present an unstructured termination detection algorithm, which uses a gossip based scheme to cope with scalability and fault-tolerance issues. This approach allows the algorithm not to maintain specific structures even when nodes join and leave during runtime. These dynamic behaviors are prevalent in cloud computing environments and little attention has been paid by existing approaches. To measure the complexity of our proposed algorithm, a new metric, self-centered message complexity is used. Our evaluation over scalable settings shows that an unstructured approach has a significant merit to solve scalability and fault-tolerance problems with lower message complexity over existing algorithms.",

    "abstract": "As computer systems have become more complex and dynamic, unstructured and decentralized techniques serve as basic building blocks in large-scale systems such as cloud computing systems. In particular, we consider a gossip-based algorithm, one of the unstructured overlay construction techniques. In this paper, we propose a membership management mechanism using the gossip-based algorithm with social graphs for the Byzantine fault tolerance problem. Experimental results show that our membership management mechanism copes with Byzantine nodes effectively in a scalable way without a bottleneck in dynamic computing environments, requiring only n ≥ 2f + 1 nodes.",

    "abstract": "Virtualization is to provide virtually all types of technologies used on the physical PC. However, in a virtualization technique, services can be modified and adjusted to satisfy user requirements, the cost of hardware purchases and hardware constructions is not occurred. Beside, this virtualization supports multiple guest operating systems on a host OS. It is helpful for virtualization to build cost-effective IT infrastructure. In general, virtualization can be classified into two categories: full virtualization and para-virtualization. Full virtualization does not require a direct interaction with host resources, but in para-virtualization a direct interaction with frequently used resources can substantially improve performance of computation. In this paper, we study the effects on the performance when the VCPUs map to the physical CPUs in para-virtualization. And we study the effects of the mapped VCPU in an overcommit environment that the number of virtual cores is more than the number of physical cores. The purpose of these experiments is to find out the best CPU allocation method in various environments of para-virtualization.",
